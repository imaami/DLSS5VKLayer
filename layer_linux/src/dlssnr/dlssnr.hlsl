// Bringing an impossible colour back into a possible one.
//
// A colour with a negative component is not a colour any display can show, and the composition can
// produce one: the model's answer is rescaled by a ratio and its chroma rebuilt, and either step can
// push a saturated pixel past the edge of the gamut.
//
// This used to be a hard clamp -- convert to AP1, max() every channel against zero, convert back --
// which is a per-channel operation on exactly the pixels most likely to breach, and per-channel
// operations on saturated pixels are the hue distorter this file warns about everywhere else. The
// channel that hits the wall first decides the colour of the rest.
//
// Instead the whole colour is scaled toward the neutral axis by one factor, so its hue survives and
// only its saturation gives way. And it is exactly nothing when nothing is out of gamut: with every
// component non-negative the scale is 1 and the colour comes back bit-for-bit.

    // at edges, and taking its hue whole there put one colour on one side of an edge and its
    // complement on the other. What it missed is that a large disagreement is also exactly what a

    // *hue* of such a pixel is decided by which channel happened to round up. The composition then
    // reads that hue as the model's verdict and amplifies it: the ratio is (modelLuma + headroom) /
    // modelLuma, which on a near-black pixel runs to a hundred and more, and the guard that follows
    // bounds luminance only -- deliberately, one scalar over the whole triple, so that a bound cannot
    // shift hue. The result is that the meaningless hue is preserved exactly and lifted to the
    // frame's own brightness.
    //
    // Simulated on this path with real 8-bit inputs: a model pixel of (0,0,1) composes to
    // (0, 0, 0.694) -- one least significant bit of blue becomes a saturated blue pixel -- and
    // (1,0,1) composes to (0.176, 0, 0.176), which is magenta. That is the dead blue, red and
    // magenta speckle, it is why it sits only on dark detailed content, and it is why it disappears
    // when the composition is bypassed: presented directly, (0,0,1) is simply a black pixel. It reads
    // as blocks rather than speckle because above a working scale of 1 the model's raster is filtered
    // down, so neighbouring output pixels share the same few codes.
    //
    // So the model's colour is trusted in proportion to how much light it actually reported, and
    // below the noise floor the frame's own hue is used instead. Measured against the same
    // simulation: codes 0 to 5 collapse to the frame's colour and codes of 12 and above come out bit
    // identical, so this cannot touch content the model had a real opinion about.

    // of 6 to 18 in 255 -- median 13 -- and only a seventh of them are anywhere the colour bound
    // engages, so on the rest the model's hue was passing through untouched. Below about 25 there are
